ros-kinetic-rosdiagnostic (1.9.0-0wily) wily; urgency=high

  * Initial release
  * Created a command to print rosdiagnostics to the console.
    Works very much like rostopic echo but instead automatically connects to the aggregated diagnostics and output in a friendly format the content of the diagnostic report.
